# Tellmewhen-3.3.5
A backport of the 4.3.4 Cataclysm version of TellMeWhen to work with the WOTLK 3.3.5 client

# How to install
1. Delete the old 3.3.5 version of TellMeWhen from your AddOns directory if you have it
2. Copy the TellMeWhen and TellMeWhen_Options folders from this repo into your AddOns directory
3. Create a backup of your WTF folder just incase
4. Login to your character and make sure TellMeWhen and TellMeWhen_Options are enabled in your AddOns panel
5. Your old TellMeWhen settings should automatically upgrade to be compatible with the backport
6. Configure TellMeWhen with the command /tmw. Enjoy your modern version of TellMeWhen!

# Why the cata version?
Well I know from experience the cata version is when TellMeWhen became very powerful. Later versions would contain too many game client and API changes that would make backporting difficult, so I figured the cata version would be the easiest to backport while having enough modern features to be enjoyable by the 3.3.5 community. The time it took to backport this from start to finish was 2 weeks.
